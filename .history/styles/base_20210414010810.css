/* dont cut me off im talking*/

/* you had a temper tantrum*/

/*i dont understand how you think its fair for you to blow up on me in front of everyone one*/

/*its embarassing as fuck and the only reason why i talked back was because i felt something off during the situation*/

/*which was when you were blowing up all over me*/

/*and i get it i fucked up but that doesnt mean you can just call me the fuck out for everyone to see  just becuase you feel upset*/

/*and honestly i wouldve taken it on the chin and not talked back if you just messaged me privately and camly*/

/* becuase you have before and ive listened. you dont need to talk to me like im a  child*/

/* its just ironic you were preaching about how we should act like adults when you couldnt even contorl your emotions.*/
